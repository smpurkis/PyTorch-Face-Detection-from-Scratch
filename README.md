## PyTorch Face Detection from Scratch

### TLDR
This project is a challenge to myself to be able to learn and implement face detection from scratch.
To do this I use the following Python libraries:
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)
- [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/)

I used original [Yolo Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640) as a reference to implement the algorithms involved.
